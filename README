##what
very minimal, mildly http compliant application for remote direct memory access.

as it currently stands, the design target is to parse GET requests that are
generated by google chrome.

##how
it takes a hex encoded pointer and a number, then it attempts to read that
many bytes from that location in memory. it mprotects the memory as read,
write, and exec before it attempts to read it. if the mprotect fails it
returns a valid hex-encoded memory address (to work as a reference pointer).
